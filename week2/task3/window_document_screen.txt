Window is the main JavaScript object root, aka the global object in a browser, also can be treated as the root of the document object model.
Since window is the global object you can reference any properties of it with just the property name - so you do not have to write down window. - it will be figured out by the runtime.
Window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser.

Screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions.
It contains properties about the user's display.

Document is the main object of the potentially visible (or better yet: rendered) document object model/DOM.
Document is where the DOM lies.
