1. Why Objects are copied & compared by reference?
	Size of Objects can not be pre-determined unlike that of primitive data types. An object may have anywhere between 1 to, say, a million elements. If we try to copy all these elements by value, the program will take a lot of time and the user would feel that it is the fault of the programing the language. To make sure such a problem is not encountered, we instead copy all objects by reference by default.


2. How to compare two JSON have the same properties without order?
	Two objects can be compared by converting them to string and comparing those strings. However, when the properties of the 2 objects are the same but are not in the same order, the converted strings when compared will not return true even when they should.
	Therefore, the way to compare two objects which have the same properties but in different orders is to compare each value individually.
