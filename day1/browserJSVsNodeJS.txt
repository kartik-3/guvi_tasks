Differences between Browser JS and Node JS.

1. Browser JS is a simple programming language which runs on any browser's JavaScript engine. Node JS is an interpreter or a running environment for a JavaScript programming language.	

2. Browser JS is used for front end tasks like script validation or interacting with front end objects. Node JS is used for server-side back end applications, for example web server and CLI tools.

3. Using Node JS console we can run JavaScript files which can not be done by browser console.

4. We can install multiple packages for Node JS and use them in the console whereas it cant be done for browser JS.

5. Node JS console doesn't need the file to be of extension .js. Node JS recognizes a java script script even in a text file.
