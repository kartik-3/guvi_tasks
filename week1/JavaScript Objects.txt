JavaScript Objects

Javascript is a prototype based language, i. e., it has the notion of a prototypical object. An object is used as a template from which to get the initial values

JavaScript objects are it's one of the most important datatypes as almost everything can be objects. Objects form the building blocks of modern JavaScript.

Unlike primitive variables which contain a single value, objects contain multiple values.

Objects in JavaScript form the basis of many important and useful concepts like Classes and Inheritance.

Internally, objects are represented as key-value pairs
For example, an object employee can be represented as follows -
	employee {
		"empId": 1,
		"empName": "Kartik",
		"dept": "engineering"
	}
The keys are also called the properties of the object.
Properties can be updated/updated by doing either employee."empName" or employee[empName].

A JavaScript Object can have prmitive variables, functions, and even other objects as its properties.
